### Future Ideas
    - ~~1.21.0 Support~~
    - Colored Messages
    - Changing Font Size of Messages (if it is possible)
    - GUI (if I have the time and capabilities)

#### Version 1.0.2 --> 1.1.0
    1. Support for game version 1.21.0:
        - This required an entirely new code to be written, so similarities between the two are negligible.
    2. .Net 7 support --> .Net 8 support
    3. Removal of command `/automsg clear`
    4. Removal of command `/automsgtest`
    5. Support for a 27-word message. Any larger will return errors.
